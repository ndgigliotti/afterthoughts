When printing out the loans that I supposedly taken out I went to the bank I was banking with at the time because I knew they never deposited any student loans into my account. When retrieving the old bank STATEMENTS from XXXX XXXX XXXX I became stressed to the max due to the account showing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL then XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX fL and over 20 check cards being used and many deposits being made and the acct was reopened without my consent after closing it 6 months prior to it being reopened without my consent. Then I noticed the acct showing financial cons data etc removing money from an altered acct I knew nothing about. The withdrawls and deposits and counter credits being made in different states and cities when i could never be in 2 states at the same time. When checking the emails attached to Dept of Edu student loan acct for XXXX and XXXX  XXXX  I knew the Vice President of XXXX university  and wife XXXX XXXX was the cause of the medical databreach that happened on me and daughter in XXXX the same year we moved from their home XX/XX/XXXX. That acct stayed opened until XX/XX/XXXX. So when calling the dept of edu they stated my acct was XXXX for XXXX ... .I def. New that was a lie ... .so I went to make an acct on irs.gov to look at account and used this acct number to log in and it stated it was the wrong acct number so then I went to where I filed taxes and noticed that whom ever got ahold to my acct used an IP pin thru the irs using my full name and my daughter 's ssn via XXXX  and XXXX . The license was altered and layered with another face the address and phone number was wrong the tax returns from XXXX thru XXXX was altered forged compromised false and the tax preparer for that year was also wrong. There was tribal ero signatures declaration numbers linked to my previous vehicles. When sending all proof it never made it to the irs and when getting 10 year drivers record for XXXX XXXX my address was changed 10 times to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sc XXXX 2 times XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sc XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sc XXXX unauthorized and without my consent via web services so I would have never known about the fraud the credit report for my daughter had alerts there was SAR ALERTS ON MY SOCIAL UNDER MY PARENTS NAMES WHOS ADDRESSES ARE LISTED ABOVE ... .WHEN GETTING XXXX XXXX ACCT INFO THERE WERE FRAUD INVESTMENT ACCTS .SEC ACCOUNTS LINKED TO ACCT WHEN GOING TO FCC.GOV DUE TO VEHICLE CYBERSECURITY ISSUES I NOTICED MY BREACHED COMPANY XXXX XXXX XXXX HAD A FRN ACCT UNDER XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SC XXXX PARENTS ADDRESS WHEN GOING TO PREVIOUS CAR INSURANCE PLACES I NOTICED CLAIMS I DIDNT FILE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY TAKEN OUTWITHOUT MY CONSENT ETC THEY ARE STEALING MY MAIL BRIBING BLACKING MAILING AGENCIES LYING ON ME FALSELY SLANDERING MY NAME ANDNMY KIDS INFORMATION ...

In the past I made payments on these loans by sending in one lump sum to the creditor to cover ALL my loans, which included those that I did take out in my name. There are four loans that I DID take out in my name but there are three loans that I DID NOT authorize to be taken out in my name. I am a victim of identity theft.

After multiple calls I did n't receive an XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX from their company for completion until XXXX XXXX, 2017. Five months later, after requesting one to be sent to be beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, they finally sent the form. They continue to report late payments and the defaulted loans to the credit reporting agencies after I was promised it would cease and be removed after receiving my XXXX XXXX XXXX. Not once has this company followed up with me. I always have to call them and when I do they always provide me with false information. I was told by several representatives that XXXX is servicing these loans and they are rejecting my fraud packet. However, whenever I call XXXX they have no record of me. This company has no regards for victims of identity theft and continue to provide me with false information and in turn are damaging my credit. I have kept a record of all communications with this company. They received a completed/notarized fraud packet on XXXX XXXX 2017 and according to the packet credit reporting was to cease 15 days after receiving the packet, which was XX/XX/XXXX. They have yet to do so and had the nerve to tell me they ca n't because XXXX rejected the packet. XXXX does n't even know who I am when I call so how can they reject a packet?
